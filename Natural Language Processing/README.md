Here I had to perform Text Mining/Sentiment Analysis for this data. The data contains all the reviews given for a musical instrument sold in Amazon and the task was to train our machine so that it can, to some extent, understand the sentiment of customer feedbacks, build a model for classifying the feedback as positive,Negative and neutral, and present the important issues the company should focus on.
